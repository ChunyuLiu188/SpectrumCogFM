# The Framework of Our Model

The SpectrumFM framework comprises three key stages. First, in the data collection and processing stage, diverse
spectrum data from multiple sources are gathered and 
preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility across datasets.
Second, during the pre-training stage, the model learns fundamental spectrum representations through self-supervised learning
tasks, namely, masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction. Finally, in the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained model is
adapted to specific downstream tasks, including AMC, WTC, SS, and AD.
